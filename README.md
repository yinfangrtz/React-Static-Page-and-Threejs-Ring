## My Scrimba Practice
## React-Static-Page-and-Threejs-Ring
The "React Static Page and Three.js Ring" project is a basic React application that showcases a static webpage with an interactive Three.js animation. It consists of three components: App, Main, and Circle.

App Component:
The main entry point of the application.
Renders the Navbar, Main, and Circle components.
Creates the overall layout of the webpage.
Main Component:
Displays the main content of the webpage.
Includes a title and a list of fun facts about React.
Provides static information about React.
Circle Component:
Utilizes Three.js library to create an interactive animation.
Renders a rotating torus shape using a PointsMaterial.
Configures the camera, scene, and renderer required for the Three.js animation.
Uses the useEffect hook to initialize and manage the animation loop.

Happy Coding!
